    "bio":"I'm a web developer who has recently graduated from an intensive 6 month boot camp at Denver University in Denver, CO. I found an interest in coding and programming from a long time passion for video games, but problem solving and taking on big challenges has always been a big part of who I am. I've done a little bit of everyhing; I graduated Regis University in 2017 with a triple major in International Business, Management and Finance. I've interned at an Engineering Firm, a Law Firm and an Accounting firm all while I was still in highschool. In college I served tables, worked as a membership salesman, a nonprofit worker, a tutor, a student teacher, a construction worker and found myself working at a Fortune 500 insurance company for over 5 years. There I started off as an intern, moved into a notice of loss position, followed by a dispatch and auto appraisal assgner, and even handled claims from start to finish in multiple business lines including property, personal auto and general liability. All the while I became a chair for the Hispanic Latino Diversity Network, a chair for DIDT (which stood for the Diverse Intern Development Team meant to help interns from diverse backgrounds transition smoothly into the corporate world), and a chair for WIAA (a group meant to empower Women in Actuarial & Analytics). I loved being able to tackle so many different kind of problems and obstacles, working them start to finish until finding a resolution. Eventually I moved back into a career in contruction, doing drywall, tape & texture, and although I love working with my hands and seeing the impact I can have on someone's life, home or business space, I missed the pace and creativity that came from some of my previous roles. The answer: get really good at programming!",
